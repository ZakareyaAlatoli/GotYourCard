<b>Got Your Card</b> is a multiplayer social deduction game where you and a group of people you know well (or <i>think</i> you do) ask questions anonymously, then each player answers the others' questions.

Finally you have to match each answer to your question with the player you think gave said answer. You get a point for each correct match.
